# Configuration

dirge reads an optional JSON config file named `config.json` from its config
folder:

- If `DIRGE_CONFIG_DIR` is set: `$DIRGE_CONFIG_DIR/config.json`
- Otherwise: the platform config directory joined with `dirge/config.json`
  (for example `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dirge/config.json` on Linux)
- Fallback: `$HOME/.config/dirge/config.json`

A project may also ship a partial `<project>/.dirge/config.json`. It is
deep-merged on top of the global file: scalar fields override, while maps
(`providers`, `mcp_servers`, `agents`, `slash_aliases`) union key-by-key, so
a project can add or override a single entry without redeclaring the whole
map. Arrays are replaced wholesale, not merged — notably `keybindings` (a
list): a project `keybindings` entry wipes the global list rather than
extending it, so redeclare the full set if you also want the global bindings. Absent keys fall through to the global file. An
empty object (e.g. `"providers": {}`) is a no-op, not a wipe — there is no
syntax to clear a global map from a project config. CLI flags and env vars
still take precedence over both files.

All config keys are optional. CLI flags and their environment-backed values
(such as `DIRGE_PROVIDER` and `DIRGE_MODEL`) take precedence where both exist.

Accepted top-level keys:

| Key                       | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider`                | string  | Active provider alias. Built-ins are `openrouter`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`/`google`, `deepseek`, `glm`/`zhipu`, `cerebras`, `opencode`, `kimi`/`kimi-code`/`moonshot`, and `ollama`; any alias declared in `providers` is also accepted. Default: `openrouter`. See [Providers and roles](#providers-and-roles). |
| `auth`                    | string  | Default authentication source for providers that don't set their own `providers.<name>.auth`: `api-key` (the implicit default), `chatgpt` (Codex/OpenAI login tokens), `anthropic` / `claude-code` (Anthropic Claude Code OAuth), or `kimi` (Kimi Code device OAuth). See [Providers and roles](#providers-and-roles). |
| `providers`               | object  | Map of provider alias → entry. The active model lives in `providers.<active-provider>.model`. Each role key below points at one of these aliases. See [Providers and roles](#providers-and-roles). |
| `review_provider`         | string  | Provider alias for the background session-review pass. Falls back to `provider`. |
| `escalation_provider`     | string  | Provider alias for the one-shot retry after repair-exhaustion / pre-write syntax failure. Falls back to `provider` (no-op when equal). |
| `summarization_provider`  | string  | Provider alias for context compaction. Falls back to `provider`; with Anthropic OAuth, configure a non-Anthropic-OAuth summarization provider for LLM compaction side calls. Reactive overflow can still use a local prune-only emergency fallback, but high-fidelity LLM summaries require this route. |
| `subagent_provider`       | string  | Provider alias for `task` tool subagents. Falls back to `provider`. |
| `subagent_dispatch_strategy` | string | Coordinated background dispatch mode: `off` (default), `optional`, or `full`. Coordination requires eligible `readonly` and `readwrite` agent profiles and runs only in the interactive TUI. See [Coordinated Subagents](subagent-dispatch-strategy.md). |
| `subagent_write_isolation` | string | Where coordinated read-write subagents run: `auto` (default), `worktree`, or `serialize`. Worktree isolation requires a confining Linux sandbox; `auto` otherwise falls back to one serialized writer in a clean parent checkout. See [Coordinated Subagents](subagent-dispatch-strategy.md#read-write-subagents-and-worktrees). |
| `critic_provider`         | string  | Provider alias for the F6 in-loop critic (tier 3). When set, the verifier escalates to a bounded LLM critique at finalization on substantive runs (one call per run); it also judges the **goal gate** (`--goal`) and powers the diff-aware **code reviewer** (reviews the run's uncommitted diff, blocks on high/critical findings, advises on medium/low — also runnable on demand via `/code-review`). **No fallback** — unset means no critic, no reviewer, no goal gate, and no cost. |
| `critic_preamble`         | string  | Optional system-preamble override for the F6 in-loop critic. Replaces the built-in critic stance for every prompt. A prompt's `critic_preamble` frontmatter overrides this per-prompt; a `critic: false` frontmatter suppresses the critic entirely for that prompt. The **goal gate** is unaffected by either — it always judges under its own fixed preamble. Unset = built-in. |
| `code_review`             | string  | How the diff-aware code reviewer engages at finalization: `off` \| `advisory` \| `blocking`. **`advisory`** (default) runs the review **in the background** after the turn finalizes and surfaces all findings (high/critical included) as one non-blocking `<system>` notice — it never holds up the turn and never re-enters the loop, so a tight debug loop isn't interrupted. **`blocking`** runs it synchronously on the finalization path: high/critical findings re-enter the loop (fix or justify), medium/low advise. **`off`** disarms it entirely (no diff capture, no judge call, zero cost). Still requires `critic_provider` (the reviewer reuses its judge); a `critic: false` prompt also suppresses it. A prompt's `code_review` frontmatter overrides this per-prompt. |
| `verification_tiers`      | string  | Splits build/test commands into a **fast** tier (typecheck, lint, one targeted test) and a **slow** tier (full suite/build): `off` \| `advisory` \| `blocking`. **`off`** (default) is byte-identical to the untiered gate. **`advisory`** adds one mid-run nudge to run a fast check once three code edits pile up unverified, plus one finalization escalation when only the fast tier ever passed. **`blocking`** repeats that escalation (bounded). Unknown commands tier as *slow*, so an unrecognized one errs toward silence. See [failure-ladder.md](failure-ladder.md). |
| `progress_stall_threshold` | integer | Turn boundaries with no progress (no todo closed, no new file touched, no green check) before the loop asks the model what's blocking and whether to cut scope. Absent (default) disables the monitor entirely. Clamped to a minimum of `2`. Also enables turn-budget notices at 60%/85% of `max_agent_turns` — those need a cap set to mean anything. Arms only after the first progress event, so an exploration phase is never nudged. See [failure-ladder.md](failure-ladder.md). |
| `progress_prologue_cap`   | integer | Barren turn boundaries (or four times that many barren tool calls) before a run that has produced *nothing at all* gets one checkpoint pushing for the smallest possible first write. Default `24`. This is an UPPER BOUND, a safety net against runaway reconnaissance — not an eager nudge — so never firing on normal work is the correct outcome. Only meaningful alongside `progress_stall_threshold`. See [verification-discipline.md](verification-discipline.md). |
| `verification_command`    | string  | The command whose pass is the only honest green — typically what CI enforces, e.g. `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`. When set and that command hasn't passed, a result that would read `VerifiedGreen` becomes `FastGreenOnly` instead, so the full-suite escalation carries it. Matched by (program, subcommand) signature, so flag and env-prefix differences don't matter. Absent (default) leaves behaviour unchanged, including in `off` mode. See [verification-discipline.md](verification-discipline.md). |
| `safe_state_abort`        | string  | Third rung of the failure ladder — when a failure streak reaches twice the recovery-checkpoint threshold with unverified edits on the tree and a green point behind it, abort the approach and re-plan: `off` \| `advisory` \| `auto`. **`off`** (default). **`advisory`** injects the re-plan message and writes no files. **`auto`** restores the tree itself, but *only* after proving against git that the snapshot store covers every file changed since the green point — one uncaptured file (a `sed -i`, a formatter, any `bash` write) and it declines to advisory rather than leaving a half-reverted tree. See [failure-ladder.md](failure-ladder.md). |
| `publish_guard`           | string  | Once verification goes green, intercept commands that would DISCARD that work — `rm` of a file in the verified diff, `git reset --hard`, `git checkout -- <path>`, `git clean -f`, `git stash`, truncating redirects: `off` \| `advisory` \| `blocking`. **`off`** (default). **`advisory`** injects a model-visible warning naming the protected paths, at most twice per run. **`blocking`** suppresses the call before dispatch and returns an error naming what it would have destroyed. Ordinary editing of a protected file is never blocked — sessions keep working after green, and blocking rewrites would nag on every edit-test cycle. No override token: `advisory` and `off` are the escape hatches. See [verification-discipline.md](verification-discipline.md). |
| `claim_gate`              | string  | Fire when the final answer makes a claim the run's evidence does not support — a test count or named-gate result (`4954 passed`, `clippy clean`) while the verifier saw no build/test command, or an applied/fixed/changed claim while zero files moved: `off` \| `advisory` \| `blocking`. **`advisory`** (default) injects one model-visible nudge per run asking it to correct the claim or run the check. **`blocking`** re-enters up to three times. **`off`** disables it (byte-identical to the loop without the gate). Deterministic — no LLM, so it can't be talked out of it or invent an accusation. Quoted output and claims attributed elsewhere (`CI reported ...`) never fire. See [verification-discipline.md](verification-discipline.md). |
| `source_gate`             | string  | Fire when a comment ADDED to a source file this run asserts having consulted an external source (`checked the X page`, `per the Y docs`) while no `webfetch`/`websearch` tool ran: `off` \| `advisory` \| `blocking`. **`off`** (default) — opt-in, unlike `claim_gate`, because it inspects the diff rather than the final answer and has a larger false-positive surface. **`advisory`** injects one nudge per run; **`blocking`** re-enters up to three times. Deterministic — no LLM. Only lines added by THIS run count (a run-start baseline diff is subtracted), and RFC citations, bug IDs, spec sections, repo file references, and URLs the code fetches at runtime are excluded. Catches a fabricated citation written into the artifact, which a final-answer scanner structurally cannot see. See [verification-discipline.md](verification-discipline.md). |
| `completeness_gate`       | string  | Fire when the final answer states first-person work the model still intended to do (`Next I'll wire up the tests`, `I still need to implement the retry path`) while the run is finishing: `off` \| `advisory` \| `blocking`. **`advisory`** (default) injects one model-visible nudge per run asking it to do the work or record what is left and say it is stopping; **`blocking`** re-enters up to three times; **`off`** is byte-identical to the loop without the gate. Deterministic — no LLM. Armed by default because without a `critic_provider` nothing else asks whether the task is finished: every other always-on gate wants a specific mechanical fault (unrun edits, a failed last call, an unsupported claim, tracked todos), so a run that edits real files, runs a real check, claims nothing false and stops halfway hits none of them. Narrow by construction — the sentence needs a first-person forward marker AND a work verb AND no second-person address, so handoffs (`you'll want to run the migration`), self-fulfilled intent (`I'll explain below`) and quoted plans never fire. Yields to the todo gate when tracked todos are outstanding. See [verification-discipline.md](verification-discipline.md). |
| `open_issues_gate`        | string  | Fire at finalization when this session left tracked issues open: `off` (default) \| `advisory` \| `blocking`. Opt-in, unlike the other gates, because nagging about a backlog is intrusive. `advisory` emits one `SystemNotice`; `blocking` re-enters the loop (bounded) so the run cannot finish until the session's issues are closed or deferred. Session-scoped — issues belonging to other sessions never surface here. |
| `injection_scan`          | string  | How the ingestion-time prompt-injection scanner treats untrusted tool results (`read`, MCP, `websearch`): `off` \| `advisory` (default) \| `block`. `advisory` fences a positive hit with a warning; `block` additionally withholds the body when two or more high-severity findings are present. |
| `turn_envelope`           | boolean | Re-evaluate the volatile session facts (cwd, OS, shell, git branch) every turn and append them as a `<turn_envelope>` block, instead of freezing them into the system prompt at agent construction. Default: `true`. Those four facts were captured once and never refreshed, so a `cd`, a `git switch`, or a worktree move left the model reading a world that no longer existed, and the only correction was rebuilding the whole cached prefix to update four lines. Appending at the tail costs no cache churn. Measured on two models at n=6: no regression on any metric, and it removed the blow-up runs on the model that was struggling. Set `false` to restore the frozen preamble. |
| `capability_projection`   | boolean | Render the prompt's tool list from the tools actually registered for the turn, minus what the active prompt's `deny_tools` removes, instead of a hand-written `Available tools:` literal. Default: `true`. The static list cannot see `deny_tools`, so plan and review mode advertised `write`/`edit`/`apply_patch`/`bash` while refusing all four — a weaker model plans against the prompt, hits a refusal, and burns turns recovering. Set `false` to restore the literal list. |
| `lean_first_request`      | boolean | Ship a minimal system prompt + core tool set (`read`, `bash`) on the first LLM request of a fresh session, then restore the full preamble and full tool surface from request 2 on. Truncate-then-grow, never swap: the lean text is a strict byte-prefix of the full preamble, so the provider's prefix cache carries the lean block across the upgrade instead of being invalidated. Default `null` (auto — enabled for DeepSeek chat models only, the port of pi-deepseek-route's first-turn anchoring for DeepSeek v4 flash); `true` forces it on for every family, `false` forces it off. Applies to the main loop and (with the `max_turns >= 2` and `{read, bash} ∩ allowed` guards) to tooled subagents; never to resumes or mid-session rebuilds, which always carry history. |
| `prompt_leak_detect`      | string  | Detect a model that stops answering and starts reciting its own system prompt: `off` \| `advisory` \| `blocking`. **`off` (default)** does no detection and emits nothing. `advisory` records it and warns, leaving the turn untouched. `blocking` also stops consuming the stream, keeping the answer given *before* the recitation and discarding the rest. Method: SimHash-64 over sliding 16-content-word windows of the output against the same windows of the prompt, tripping only on 12 consecutive near-matches — roughly 55 words reproduced verbatim. The margin is smaller than it sounds: two ordinary sentences quoted word-for-word reach a run of 6, so do not lower the threshold without re-running the fixtures in `agent_loop::prompt_leak`. Off by default because the failure has not yet been observed in dirge; `advisory` exists so it can be measured before it is trusted. |
| `context_target` | integer | Working-context budget in tokens (default: `250000`). The compaction decision treats the effective window as `min(model_window, context_target)`, so models with a window below 250k use their own (e.g. 128k stays 128k) while larger models are capped. Set lower (e.g. `100000`) for stricter folding on cost-sensitive routes. Floored at 16k. |
| `compaction_fold_threshold` | float | Fraction of the (budgeted) context window (0.3–0.75) at which history folds into a summary — and the durable checkpoint is written. Lower folds/checkpoints earlier, from more coherent context. Unset keeps the 0.75 default. Composes with `context_target`: the fold point is `fraction × min(model_window, context_target)`. |
| `incremental_checkpoint`  | bool    | Refresh the durable session checkpoint in the background at 20%-of-window usage thresholds, without folding, so a resumed session recovers fresh state (adapted from [MiMo-Code](https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-Code)). Default `true`; set `false` to disable the background summary calls. Forced off in headless `-p`/`--loop` (nothing there persists it). |
| `file_excerpt_cap_tokens` | integer | Per-result token cap for `read` excerpts (default: `12000`). Every tool result is head+tail truncated at the turn-end cap (3000 tokens, or 1000 once context passes 60%); a file excerpt gets this roomier allowance instead, because it is the material the next edit is written against and `edit_lines` anchors on line hashes that only survive while the rows are intact. Raise it for a codebase of large files; set it to `3000` to hold reads to the same cap as any other tool output. Floored at 3000, and the aggressive tier still overrides it. See [Large file reads](#large-file-reads). |
| `agents`                  | object  | Optional user-defined [agent profiles](agents.md), keyed by name. Each is a `{ prompt, model, deny_tools/allow_tools, reasoning, temperature, description, subagent }` bundle activated at runtime with `/agent <name>`. Lowest-precedence source — `.dirge/agents/*.md` and `~/.config/dirge/agents/*.md` override same-named entries. Absent = no profiles (opt-in). |
| `max_tokens`              | integer | Maximum response tokens. Default: `8192`.                                                                                                                                   |
| `max_agent_turns`         | integer | Maximum agent turns per response. Default: `100`.                                                                                                                           |
| `temperature`             | number  | Model sampling temperature in `0.0`–`2.0`. `--temperature` CLI flag overrides this. Values outside the range are clamped with a stderr warning.                            |
| `no_tools`                | boolean | Disable all tools. Default: `false`.                                                                                                                                        |
| `no_context_files`        | boolean | Disable loading global/project `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` context files. Default: `false`.                                                                                 |
| `no_skills`               | boolean | Disable on-disk skill discovery: no skill catalog in the preamble and no `skill` tool. Discovery normally spans `~/.claude`, `~/.opencode`, `~/.agents`, `~/.dirge` `/skills` plus every project ancestor, and honours neither `DIRGE_CONFIG_DIR` nor `DIRGE_DATA_DIR` — so this is the lever for reproducible runs (`scripts/loop-ab.sh` sets it). Default: `false`. |
| `skill_anchor_interval`   | integer | Restate loaded skills' declared `anchor:` sections every N turn boundaries. `0` (default) is off. Preserving an anchor through a compaction happens whenever a skill declares one; this is the other half, for skills whose own spec says the anchor must RECUR. Every fire costs tokens, so the rate is yours to set. Note the interval is a FLOOR, not a schedule: the boundary chain returns one nudge and correctness nudges outrank this one, so the effective rate is lower whenever the run is also being steered. |
| `context_window`          | integer | Advertised model context window — feeds the status line and the legacy token-reserve path (the compaction *fold* decision uses `context_target`, not this). Resolved as: `providers.<name>.context_window` → this key → built-in per-model table → `128000`. Set it **per provider** when more than one is configured; this top-level key applies to all of them, so correcting one model's window here corrupts the rest. The table usually decides, e.g. Claude Sonnet/Opus 4.x, DeepSeek-V4, GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Llama-4 = 1M (Gemini-2.5-Pro = 2M); base Claude and o3 = 200k; GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and older 128k models = 128k. A model neither lookup knows warns once and falls back to `128000`. |
| `reserve_tokens`          | integer | Tokens to reserve before compaction is triggered. Default: `16384`.                                                                                                         |
| `thinking_budget_tokens`  | integer | Absolute cap on one turn's reasoning trace, in estimated tokens, enforced on dirge's side of the stream — the provider-side budget is a request, and a locally-served model honours it only as far as its template does. Crossing it truncates the trace and disables thinking for the rest of the task. Absent (default) derives a cap per turn instead. |
| `keep_recent_tokens`      | integer | Approximate recent-token budget kept verbatim during compaction. Default: `20000`.                                                                                          |
| `compact_enabled`         | boolean | Enable automatic conversation compaction. Default: `true`.                                                                                                                  |
| `compact_tool_schemas`    | string  | Trim tool schemas to breadcrumbs on a small context window: `auto` (default) \| `on` \| `off`. `auto` engages at or below a 48k resolved window. Each tool's description is cut to its first sentence and each parameter's to a clause; names, types, enums and required-ness are untouched, so the model keeps everything it needs to form a well-formed call and loses only the prose about when to prefer one tool over another. No tool is dropped — a model that cannot see a tool cannot ask for it, and that failure is silent and reads as incapability. The full surface is ~16k tokens with the built-ins alone and ~32.6k with MCP servers loaded, the latter larger than a 32k window in its entirety. |
| `dynamic_tool_search`     | boolean | Ship only `tool_search` + a small always-on toolset per request; the model loads more tools on demand via `tool_search(query)`. The always-on set covers the core loop (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `glob`, `list_dir`) plus `write_todo_list` and `task_status`, so only the long tail (MCP, semantic, spec, debug) needs discovery. ~30% token savings on MCP-heavy sessions. Default: `false`. |
| `code_mode_rubric`        | boolean | Append the "code mode" rubric to the system prompt: for a bulk/fan-out of similar tool calls (roughly 10+ items), write ONE `bash` script that returns only the distilled result instead of N per-item calls, keeping raw output out of context. Default: `false`. See [code-mode-rubric.md](code-mode-rubric.md) for the measured effect. |
| `context_depth_reminder_threshold` | integer | Consecutive same-file tool calls before a single mid-turn reminder restates the active task + touched files. Opt-in; unset (default) disables. Recommended value: `8`. |
| `phased_workflow_enabled` | boolean | Enable the `/plan` phased workflow (explore → plan → implement → reviewer-runs-code loop). Master kill-switch — `/plan` is inert unless this is `true`. Default: `false`. See [agent-loop.md](agent-loop.md#phased-plan-workflow-plan). |
| `phased_workflow_max_review_cycles` | integer | Reviewer-runs-code fix-cycle budget for `/plan`: how many times a `NEEDS_FIX` verdict re-runs the implementer before stopping. Default: `2`. |
| `phased_workflow_plan_approval` | boolean | Pause `/plan` after the plan phase and prompt to **approve / edit / cancel** before any code is written. On `edit` you type feedback and the plan is regenerated for another review. Default: `false` (implement immediately). See [agent-loop.md](agent-loop.md#phased-plan-workflow-plan). |
| `permission`              | object  | Permission rules; see the permission config notes below.                                                                                                                    |
| `restrictive`             | boolean | Select restrictive permission mode. Overridden by `accept_all`/`yolo` if those are also true.                                                                               |
| `accept_all`              | boolean | Select accept mode, equivalent to `--accept-all`. Overridden by `yolo` if true.                                                                                             |
| `yolo`                    | boolean | Select yolo mode, auto-approving all operations.                                                                                                                            |
| `sandbox`                 | bool / string / object | Sandbox bash commands. `true`/`false`, a mode string (`"off"`, `"bwrap"`, `"microvm"`), or an object — see [Sandbox configuration](#sandbox-configuration). Default: `false`. |
| `default_permission_mode` | string  | Permission mode when no mode boolean/CLI flag is set. Use `standard`, `restrictive`, `accept`, or `yolo`.                                                                   |
| `show_tool_details`       | boolean | Show tool-result output in the TUI. Default: `true`.                                                                                                                         |
| `show_edit_diff`          | boolean | Show colorized diff output for `edit` tool results (`-` red, `+` green, `@@` cyan). Default: `true`.                                                                        |
| `animations_enabled`      | boolean | Enable TUI animations (avatar face toggling, spinner repaint timer). Default: `true`. Set to `false` to reduce terminal flicker and CPU usage; the avatar freezes to a static face. |
| `show_reasoning`          | boolean | Show the model's thinking/reasoning by default, instead of having to press `Ctrl+O` each turn. Default: `false`.                                                            |
| `keyboard_enhancement`    | boolean | Enable the terminal's enhanced keyboard (kitty) protocol so distinct chords like `Shift+Enter` reach the input editor (Shift+Enter then inserts a newline via `insert_newline` instead of submitting). Only takes effect on terminals that advertise support (kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm, foot, rio, …); a harmless no-op elsewhere — use `Alt+Enter` or `Ctrl+J` there. Default: `true`. Set `false` to disable if your terminal misbehaves. |
| `desktop_notifications`   | object  | Optional OS-level desktop notifications. Off when absent. Set `{ "enabled": true }` to notify on completed runs and prompts waiting for input. Backed by `notify-rust` on macOS, Linux, and Windows. |
| `max_sessions`            | integer | How many of the most-recent prior sessions in the same project (same working dir) to mine for Up-arrow / Ctrl+F command history, seeded ahead of the current session's prompts. Default: `3`. Set `0` to keep recall to the current session only. See [Command history](#command-history-cross-session-recall). |
| `display`                 | string  | Preferred startup pane layout: a `\|`/`,`/space-separated subset of `left`, `main`, `right` (e.g. `"main\|right"`, `"main"`). The main pane is always shown; this picks which side panels appear. Override at runtime with `/display`. Default: automatic (side panels shown at ≥152 cols). |
| `tool_result_max_chars`   | integer | Hard ceiling on characters per tool result. Default: `500`. Combined with `tool_result_max_lines` (lines applied first; chars trim what's left).                                |
| `tool_result_max_lines`   | integer | Body lines shown inside a tool chamber before collapsing to `↓ N more lines (Ctrl+O to expand)`. Default: `4`. Press `Ctrl+O` to re-print the most recent collapsed result in full. `edit`, `apply_patch`, `question`, `task`, and `task_status` are exempt (their body IS the value). |
| `default_prompt`          | string  | Prompt name to activate on startup. Default: `code`.                                                                                                                        |
| `theme`                   | string  | UI color theme. `phosphor` (default — 80s CRT green-on-black), `plain` (pre-theme white/cyan), or any `<name>.theme.json` file in the config dir. See [themes.md](themes.md). |
| `tools`                   | object  | Per-tool settings. `tools.websearch` / `tools.webfetch` (`bool`, default `true`) gate the two web tools, but only as one operand of an OR: a tool is registered when its config value is true **or** its env var (`WEBSEARCH_ENABLED` / `WEBFETCH_ENABLED`; truthy = `true` or `1`) is set — so an explicit config `false` is re-enabled by the env var, not dropped. `tools.bash_output_inline_max_bytes`, `tools.webfetch_output_inline_max_bytes`, and `tools.task_output_inline_max_bytes` (`integer`, default `8192` each) cap how much of a `bash` / `webfetch` / `task` result is returned inline versus relayed to `~/.dirge/transient/<pid>/` with a head/tail summary and a `read`-tool hint. |
| `memory`                  | object  | Long-term memory retrieval tuning. See [Hybrid memory retrieval](#hybrid-memory-retrieval) below. Absent = the builtin BM25 store. |
| `memory_graduation`       | boolean | Recurrence-weighted salience graduation for the memory curator: detect near-duplicate entries and boost the representative's salience. Default `true`. Non-destructive — it never merges or deletes; the LLM curator pass still owns dedup. |
| `mcp_servers`             | object  | MCP server map when compiled with the `mcp` feature. When omitted, defaults to a single Exa Web Search server; see below.                                                   |
| `acp_servers`             | object  | ACP server config map when compiled with the `acp` feature. See the ACP section below.                                                                                       |
| `editor_open_command`     | string  | Opt-in editor follow-along: a command template with `{path}` and `{line}` placeholders (e.g. `"zed {path}:{line}"`, `"code --goto {path}:{line}"`). When set, dirge opens files it reads or edits in this external GUI editor, detached and non-blocking — the editor "follows along" like Zed's AI panel. `None` (unset) disables the feature entirely. |

### Desktop Notifications

Desktop notifications are off unless `desktop_notifications.enabled` is set.
dirge uses `notify-rust` on macOS, Linux, and Windows: a system notification
banner on macOS (sent through the Terminal sender), a freedesktop D-Bus
notification on Linux (needs a running notification daemon), and a WinRT toast
on Windows. On macOS the banner is attributed to Terminal and on Windows to
PowerShell, since dirge doesn't register its own notification identity.

```json
{
  "desktop_notifications": {
    "enabled": true,
    "on_completion": true,
    "on_input_required": true
  }
}
```

When enabled, omitted `on_completion` / `on_input_required` keys default to
`true`. `on_completion` fires only when a run actually returns to idle, not when
an automatic follow-up, reviewer pass, loop iteration, or queued interjection
continues immediately.

### Context window & compaction

Two keys control how large the live context grows before history is folded
into a summary (compaction):

- **`context_target`** — the working-context budget in tokens (default
  `250000`). The decision treats the effective window as `min(model_window,
  context_target)`, so a model whose window is under the budget uses its own
  (128k stays 128k) while models advertising 1M+ are held to the budget rather
  than folding on a fraction of their full window. Context quality degrades
  gradually past ~100k and varies by model, so 250k is a middle ground — set it
  lower (e.g. `100000`) for smaller local models or cost-sensitive routes (see
  the [README](../README.md#a-bounded-context-budget-on-purpose) for the
  reasoning). Floored at 16k; a value above the model's real window is a no-op.
- **`compaction_fold_threshold`** — the fraction of that budget at which the
  fold (and durable checkpoint) fires, clamped to `0.3`–`0.75` (default
  `0.75`). Lower folds earlier, from more coherent context.

The **fold point** — the size the context reaches before compaction kicks in —
is the product of the two:

```
fold_point = compaction_fold_threshold × min(model_window, context_target)
```

Examples below assume a large-window model (≥250k) so the budget is what
binds; on a smaller model the fold point is `fraction × model_window` instead.

| Goal | `context_target` | `compaction_fold_threshold` | Folds at |
| ---- | ---------------- | --------------------------- | -------- |
| Default | unset (250k) | unset (0.75) | ~188k |
| Smaller, tighter context | `60000` | unset (0.75) | ~45k |
| Same budget, fold earlier | unset (250k) | `0.5` | ~125k |
| Both | `80000` | `0.6` | ~48k |

```json
{
  "context_target": 80000,
  "compaction_fold_threshold": 0.6
}
```

Set `compact_enabled` to `false` to disable automatic compaction entirely.
(The separate `context_window` / `reserve_tokens` keys feed the status line and
the older token-reserve path; the budget above is what the fold decision uses.)

### Large file reads

Two separate mechanisms shrink what the model sees of a file, and they have
different knobs.

**The turn-end result cap.** Every tool result is head+tail truncated before
each send: 3000 tokens normally, 1000 once estimated context passes 60%. The
model that *called* the tool sees the full result on that turn; later turns see
the truncation. A `read` excerpt is held to `file_excerpt_cap_tokens` (default
12000) instead, because it is the material the next edit is written against and
`edit_lines` anchors on line hashes that only survive while rows are intact.

```json
{
  "file_excerpt_cap_tokens": 40000
}
```

Raise it if you work in a codebase of large files and see the agent re-reading
the same one; set it to `3000` to hold reads to the same cap as any other tool
output. It is floored at 3000, and the aggressive (>60% context) tier still
overrides it — a roomier allowance is worth nothing if the request stops
fitting. Truncation always cuts on a line boundary, so surviving rows keep
their `<n> <hash>: ` prefixes and stay usable as `edit_lines` anchors.

**Prompt compression.** The `[compression]` engine windows verbose *tool
output* (logs, diffs, grep dumps). It does not touch source files, file
excerpts, or your own messages. Those exemptions have overrides, but they exist
for A/B testing the change that introduced them and there is no reason to turn
them on:

| Key | Default | Effect when set |
|-----|---------|-----------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | `false` disables compression entirely — request bodies go out untouched. |
| `preset` | `"dirge"` | Named profile. `"safe"` / `"lossless"` are also output-neutral; `"agent"`, `"aggressive"`, `"auto"`, `"rag"`, `"code"` enable lossy stages **and** directives that alter the model's output. |
| `trim_user_text` | `false` | Let windowing touch your own messages too. |
| `window_code` | `false` | Let windowing fold and window code and file excerpts. |
| `header` | `"explicit"` | `"legacy"` restores the pre-0.21.10 elision-header wording. |
| `verbatim` | `true` | `false` ignores `read(verbatim=true)`'s compression opt-out. |

To turn it off for one run without editing config, pass `--no-compression` or
set `DIRGE_COMPRESSION=0` (`off`, `false`, `no`, and `disabled` also work).
`DIRGE_COMPRESSION_PRESET` overrides `preset` the same way. Precedence is
most-local-wins: the CLI flag beats the env var, which beats the config file.

If you need a guarantee that what you are looking at is byte-for-byte what is
on disk, call `read` with `verbatim: true` — that result is exempt from
compression entirely.

### Hybrid memory retrieval

By default the `memory` tool's `search` is BM25 (keyword) only — exact on
paths, error codes, and identifiers, but blind to paraphrase. Opt into hybrid
dense+BM25 retrieval to also recover semantically-related entries, fused with
Reciprocal Rank Fusion. It needs an OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint.

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "hybrid_retrieval": true,
    "embed_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings",
    "embed_model": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "embed_api_key_env": "OPENAI_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

| Key                 | Type    | Description |
| ------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `hybrid_retrieval`  | boolean | Turn on dense+BM25 fusion. Default `false`. |
| `embed_url`         | string  | OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` endpoint. **Required** for hybrid; if unset, retrieval stays BM25. |
| `embed_model`       | string  | Embedding model id. Default `text-embedding-3-small` — set it when pointing at a non-OpenAI endpoint. |
| `embed_api_key_env` | string  | Name of the env var holding the API key (the key itself is never stored in config). Omit for a keyless local endpoint. |
| `verbatim_pre_recall` | boolean | Each turn, auto-search memory on the verbatim user message and inject the hits as a supplemental context note (separate from the frozen system-prompt snapshot — it never changes the cached prefix). Surfaces relevant memory the agent wouldn't think to look up. Works with BM25 or hybrid. Default `false`. |
| `confirm_writes`    | boolean | Require human confirmation before any memory `add` is stored. See [Confirming memory writes](#confirming-memory-writes). Default `false`. |

### Confirming memory writes

dirge decides what is worth remembering on its own. The agent writes mid-session
whenever it judges something memorable, and after an idle session the background
review and memory curator — forked LLM runners — write more. All of it lands in
the system prompt of every later session in the project, and under global scope,
of every project.

`confirm_writes` puts a human in that loop:

```json
{ "memory": { "confirm_writes": true } }
```

An `add` is then *queued* rather than stored. A queued entry is inert — it is not
in the prompt snapshot, not in `memory view`, and not in `memory search` — and the
model is told plainly that it is not yet stored, so it does not treat the fact as
durable. Review them with:

```
/memory review
```

which opens the queue in `$EDITOR`. **The file is the desired final state**: delete
a block to reject it, edit the text to reword it, or type a new block to record
something the model never noticed. Saving stores exactly what is in the file;
quitting without saving (`:cq`) leaves the queue untouched for next time. Accepted
entries go in through the normal write path, so a memory you typed is
indistinguishable from one the agent proposed.

Only `add` is gated. `replace`, `supersede` and `remove` act on entries you already
accepted, and `supersede` usually fires because you just corrected the agent —
asking you to confirm your own correction would be noise.

A notice appears when the queue is non-empty, both after the post-session passes
and once at startup. Headless `-p` has no one to ask, so entries simply queue there
and wait for your next interactive session; nothing is auto-accepted and nothing is
lost.

Safe by default and on failure: with `hybrid_retrieval` off, or the endpoint
unset/unreachable/timed out, search silently falls back to BM25 — it never
errors. Embeddings are computed at search time (the first search of a session
embeds all active entries; later searches only embed the query) and cached for
the session.

Cost note: enabling `hybrid_retrieval` **and** `verbatim_pre_recall` together
means roughly one embeddings API call per agent turn (pre-recall searches the
verbatim message every turn, and with hybrid each search embeds the query). On
a paid endpoint that adds up over a long session; on a local endpoint it's just
latency.

## Providers and roles

Providers are declared once in the `providers` map and referenced by alias from
the role-assignment keys — so each role can run on a different model:

```json
{
  "provider": "deepseek",
  "review_provider": "glm",
  "escalation_provider": "anthropic",
  "subagent_provider": "glm",

  "providers": {
    "deepseek": {
      "model": "deepseek-v4-pro"
    },
    "glm": {
      "model": "glm-4.6"
    },
    "anthropic": {
      "model": "claude-opus-4-5"
    },
    "ollama": {
      "provider_type": "openai",
      "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1",
      "model": "llama3.1"
    }
  }
}
```

Each `providers` entry accepts:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `provider_type` | Built-in backend to use: `openrouter`, `openai`, `openai-responses`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `deepseek`, `glm`, `cerebras`, `opencode`, `kimi`, `ollama`, or `custom`. Optional — defaults to the entry's alias when that alias matches a built-in name. `openai` speaks the Chat Completions API (`/v1/chat/completions`); `openai-responses` speaks the Responses API (`/v1/responses`) — see below. |
| `base_url` | Endpoint base URL (for custom / self-hosted endpoints). |
| `model` | Model name for this provider. |
| `api_key` | Literal key or `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation. Takes precedence over `api_key_env`. |
| `api_key_env` | Name of the env var holding the API key. |
| `auth` | Authentication mode: `api-key` (default), `chatgpt` for Codex/OpenAI login tokens, `anthropic` / `claude-code` for Anthropic Claude Code OAuth, or `kimi` for Kimi Code (Moonshot) device OAuth. |
| `allow_insecure` | Allow `http://` URLs (plaintext). Default `false`; only enable for local-only proxies. |
| `context_window` | Context window for this provider's model, in tokens. Takes precedence over the top-level `context_window` and the built-in model table, and is the key to reach for when more than one provider is configured — the top-level one applies to all of them. Every compaction threshold divides by this number, so a wrong one folds a context with room to spare or fails to fold one without. Needed for a self-hosted or locally-served model, whose name is often a file path the model table cannot match. |
| `stream_chunk_timeout_secs` | Per-provider streaming chunk timeout override. |
| `effort` | Default reasoning effort for this provider's model: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`. `xhigh` and `max` are distinct tiers on OpenAI and Anthropic (`xhigh` for long-horizon agentic work, `max` for unconstrained capability); providers that lack an `xhigh` tier fold `xhigh` up to `max` (GLM-5.3 takes `low`/`high`/`max`; DeepSeek has no `xhigh` but does accept `medium`) or to `high` (Cerebras takes `low`/`medium`/`high`). Providers that don't accept a given level collapse it to the nearest one they do — e.g. GLM-5.3 takes only `low`/`high`/`max`, so `medium`/`minimal` go out as `high`/`low`. A `/effort` session override takes precedence over this. Unrecognized values are warned and ignored. |
| `multimodal` | Override for whether this provider/model accepts image input (gates the Ctrl+V image-paste UX). `true`/`false` forces it either way; omit to auto-detect from the model name and provider type. Set `true` to enable pasting into a local vision model (e.g. Ollama `llama3.2-vision`) behind a generic provider type. |
| `headers` | Extra HTTP request headers. A value that is exactly `${ENV_VAR}` is replaced by that environment variable (an unset variable is a hard error); any other value, including one with `${…}` embedded in surrounding text, is sent literally. |
| `options` | Free-form per-provider model options; currently honors `temperature`. |

The aliases on the left of the map become the values you write in
role-assignment keys.

### OpenAI Chat Completions vs Responses API

`provider_type: "openai"` sends requests to the Chat Completions endpoint
(`/v1/chat/completions`). Some OpenAI-compatible endpoints only expose the
newer Responses API (`/v1/responses`) — e.g. an OAuth proxy that mirrors what
OpenAI itself serves for GPT-5+. Set `provider_type: "openai-responses"` to
target that endpoint instead:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "gpt5-proxy": {
      "provider_type": "openai-responses",
      "model": "gpt-5.6",
      "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8639/v1",
      "api_key": "${MY_PROXY_KEY}",
      "allow_insecure": true
    }
  }
}
```

It behaves like `openai` in every other respect (default model, API-key auth,
`base_url` handling) — only the request shape and endpoint differ. The api key
is sent as a bearer token; unlike `auth: chatgpt` this uses no OAuth/Codex
login, so it works against any plain `/v1/responses` server. (`allow_insecure`
is honored here since no OAuth bearer is involved.)

### GitHub Copilot

Copilot has no built-in `provider_type`; it does not need one. Its endpoint is
OpenAI-compatible, so it is reached with the generic `openai` /
`openai-responses` types and a `base_url` of `https://api.githubcopilot.com`.

Get a token from the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh auth login
export GH_API_KEY="$(gh auth token)"
```

Then point one or more provider entries at Copilot. Different Copilot models
sit behind different APIs, so the `provider_type` is per model — the Responses
API for the ones that require it, Chat Completions for the rest:

```json
{
  "provider": "grok45",
  "critic_provider": "luna56",
  "summarization_provider": "luna56",
  "approval_provider": "luna56",
  "providers": {
    "grok45": {
      "provider_type": "openai-responses",
      "base_url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com",
      "api_key": "${GH_API_KEY}",
      "model": "grok-4.5",
      "multimodal": true
    },
    "luna56": {
      "provider_type": "openai",
      "base_url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com",
      "api_key": "${GH_API_KEY}",
      "model": "gpt-5.6-luna",
      "multimodal": true
    }
  }
}
```

`api_key` is expanded at use time, so the token stays in the environment rather
than in the config file. Which models you can select depends on your Copilot
plan, and `gh auth token` returns a token tied to your `gh` login — re-export
it after re-authenticating.

### Cerebras

Cerebras needs no `providers` entry. Export its API key and select the built-in:

```bash
export CEREBRAS_API_KEY="..."
dirge --provider cerebras  # defaults to gemma-4-31b
```

The built-in sends OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions requests to
`https://api.cerebras.ai/v1`. To pin another Cerebras model, add only the
model override; keep the secret in `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`:

```json
{
  "provider": "cerebras",
  "providers": {
    "cerebras": {
      "model": "gpt-oss-120b"
    }
  }
}
```

Set `providers.cerebras.base_url` to an HTTPS proxy or custom Cerebras
endpoint. Dirge does not read a separate `CEREBRAS_BASE_URL` variable:

```json
{
  "provider": "cerebras",
  "providers": {
    "cerebras": {
      "model": "gemma-4-31b",
      "base_url": "https://cerebras-proxy.example.com/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

Reasoning and image support depend on the model. For `gemma-4-31b`, Dirge
sends top-level `reasoning_effort` values (`low`, `medium`, or `high`) and
accepts image input. It clamps lower and higher Dirge reasoning levels to that
three-value set and omits the field when reasoning is off. Dirge treats
`gpt-oss-120b` and `zai-glm-4.7` as text-only. This integration does not expose
other Cerebras-specific request options.

### OpenAI browser / device-code auth

Run `dirge auth openai` to authorize OpenAI through the browser OAuth flow and
persist a local OAuth refresh token. Dirge prints an OpenAI authorization URL
and waits for the browser redirect on `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback`.
This is the preferred ChatGPT/Codex subscription login path.

For headless environments, run `dirge auth openai --device-code` to use the
older device-code flow. Before using that mode, enable device-code auth in
ChatGPT Codex security settings. Dirge prints the OpenAI verification URL and
user code; the user code is part of the interactive login UX, but you should
not share it with anyone.

The credential store lives in the Dirge data directory, not the repository or
program directory:

- Linux default: `~/.local/share/dirge/auth.json`
- Override: `$DIRGE_DATA_DIR/auth.json`

Successful login persists across Dirge sessions. Delete `auth.json` or revoke
the OpenAI authorization if you want to force a new login.

For the canonical `openai` provider with no configured `base_url`, a fresh
stored OAuth credential is treated as subscription auth and is preferred before
API-key billing. Explicit `auth: "chatgpt"` also uses this fresh Dirge-managed
OpenAI OAuth credential before falling back to legacy `~/.codex/auth.json`
storage, so rerunning `dirge auth openai` is enough to recover from a stale
Codex login file. OpenAI-compatible aliases and providers with a custom
`base_url` keep normal API-key behavior. If no fresh OAuth credential exists,
Dirge uses the usual API-key sources: explicit CLI keys, key files/stdin, config
`api_key`, config `api_key_env`, and provider environment variables. If the
OAuth/Codex request reports subscription quota or model-access exhaustion, Dirge
asks before switching that request to API-key billing.

Troubleshooting:

- Browser callback port is busy: stop the process using port 1455 and rerun
  `dirge auth openai`, or use `dirge auth openai --device-code` in a headless
  environment.
- `OpenAI device-code auth is not enabled` or a 404 from the user-code endpoint:
  enable device-code auth in ChatGPT Codex security settings and rerun
  `dirge auth openai --device-code`.
- Timeout: complete approval in the browser and rerun the command.
- Corrupt auth store: fix or remove `auth.json`, then rerun `dirge auth openai`.

### Anthropic Claude Code OAuth

To use a Claude Pro/Max subscription token instead of an Anthropic API key,
run:

```bash
dirge auth anthropic
```

Complete the browser login. dirge listens on `http://localhost:53692/callback`,
exchanges the PKCE code, and writes credentials to
`~/.claude/.credentials.json` in the same shape as Claude Code. Then configure
the Anthropic provider to use OAuth:

```json
{
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "auth": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5"
    }
  }
}
```

Aliases `claude-code`, `claude_code`, and `claude` are accepted for the same
auth mode. `ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN` can also provide a raw access token for
smoke tests, but persisted credentials are preferred because dirge can refresh
expired tokens before rebuilding the Anthropic client.

### Kimi Code (Moonshot) OAuth

To use a Kimi membership's managed coding API instead of a raw API key, run:

```bash
dirge auth kimi   # alias: dirge auth kimi-code
```

This is a device-code flow (there is no browser/localhost variant): Dirge
prints a verification URL and user code, you authorize in the browser, and
Dirge polls until the login completes. The credential is stored under the
`kimi` key in the same `$DIRGE_DATA_DIR/auth.json` used by the other OAuth
logins.

Then select the provider (a stored login is also auto-detected when no
provider/env key is configured):

```json
{
  "provider": "kimi",
  "providers": {
    "kimi": {
      "model": "k3"
    }
  }
}
```

Models: `k3` (default), `kimi-for-coding`, and `kimi-for-coding-highspeed`,
all OpenAI-compatible chat completions against
`https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1` with a 262144-token context window. Lower
membership tiers without K3 access should use `--model kimi-for-coding`.

Kimi access tokens live only 15 minutes; Dirge refreshes them automatically
(before client construction and mid-session) and persists the rotated token
bundle, so a long session does not die on token expiry.

Environment overrides:

- `KIMI_CODE_API_KEY` — static bearer used instead of the OAuth login (not
  refreshable).
- `KIMI_CODE_BASE_URL` — API base URL override (https only).
- `KIMI_CODE_OAUTH_HOST` / `KIMI_OAUTH_HOST` — OAuth host override (default
  `https://auth.kimi.com`).

Aliases `kimi-code` and `moonshot` are accepted for the provider name and
the `auth` mode. The separate Kimi Platform API (`api.moonshot.ai`) is not
this provider — use a `custom` provider with an API key for that.

### Prompt caching

dirge asks each provider to cache the stable part of every request (the system
prompt and tool definitions, plus the conversation history where the provider
supports it) so it is billed once instead of on every turn. Cached input reads
at roughly a tenth of the normal rate, which makes the cache hit ratio the main
cost lever on a long session. `/cache` reports that ratio along with the
cumulative read and write totals.

Nothing needs configuring for this to work. Most providers cache the longest
matching prefix by themselves; where an explicit breakpoint is required
(Anthropic directly, and the Anthropic, Qwen and Gemini routes through
OpenRouter) dirge places one.

The one knob is how long an Anthropic cache entry lives:

```json
{
  "prompt_cache": { "ttl": "1h" }
}
```

`"1h"` (the default) or `"5m"`. The tradeoff is in the write price: a 1h write
costs 2x the base input rate against 1.25x for 5m, while reads are a tenth
either way. A read refreshes a 5m entry, so a session that keeps working stays
warm on 5m and never pays the premium. What 1h buys is the idle gap: if more
than five minutes pass between turns, a lapsed 5m entry means re-writing the
whole prefix on the next turn rather than just that turn's delta. Pick `"5m"`
if your sessions run continuously, keep `"1h"` if you leave dirge sitting while
you read or work elsewhere. `DIRGE_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL` overrides the setting at
runtime.

### Role assignments

| Key | Used for | Falls back to |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| `provider` | Default / main loop | (none — required) |
| `review_provider` | Background session-review pass | `provider` |
| `escalation_provider` | One-shot retry after repair-exhaustion / pre-write syntax failure | `provider` (no-op when equal) |
| `summarization_provider` | Context compaction side calls (required for LLM compaction when `provider` uses Anthropic OAuth) | `provider` when safe |
| `subagent_provider` | `task` tool subagents | `provider` |
| `critic_provider` | F6 in-loop critic (tier 3) + diff-aware code reviewer (`/code-review`) + goal-gate judge (`--goal`) | none (off) |

When a role's provider equals `provider` (either explicitly or by fallback), no
duplicate client is constructed and the feature has zero overhead — escalation
routes, for example, simply don't fire because they'd be a no-op anyway.

> `custom_providers`, or `review_model` keys — starting a session with any of
> those at the root fails fast with a migration hint. Move `model` inside the

## Permissions

Permission actions are lowercase strings: `allow`, `ask`, or `deny`. `rules`
is an **ordered list** read top-to-bottom; **last match wins**. Each rule has:

- `op` — the operation class it governs (NOT a tool name). One of:
  `read`, `edit`, `execute`, `network`, `mcp`, `memory`, `skill`,
  `agent`, `meta`, or `*` (any). `edit` covers write/edit/apply_patch —
  they're one operation, so one rule governs all three.
- `match` — a glob. Read/edit use path-style globs (`*` is one path
  segment, `**` spans directories); execute/network/mcp use shell-style
  (`*` matches anything including `/`, trailing ` *` makes args optional).
  The `*` (any) op uses shell-style too, since it can match commands and
  MCP keys as well as paths. MCP patterns match the full key
  `mcp_tool:{server}:{tool}`.
- `effect` — `allow`, `ask`, or `deny`.
- `tool` *(optional)* — narrow the rule to a single concrete tool name
  (e.g. `"grep"`) instead of the whole op.

Use `"*"` for the default action, `external_directory` (also a `rules`
list, op defaults to `*`) for absolute-path rules outside the working
directory, and `doom_loop` for the retry-loop hard-deny (set to `allow`
to disable it). dirge always installs its built-in safe bash allow/deny
rules and a read-only/memory/skill/in-cwd-write allow set beneath your
rules; your `rules` override them.

MCP tools default to `ask` for ALL servers — they execute external code
(the server's implementation, plus whatever filesystem / network / API
effects it has), and silent default-allow let entire query sequences run
before any prompt fired. To re-enable silent allow for a trusted server:

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "rules": [
      { "op": "mcp", "match": "mcp_tool:lattice:*", "effect": "allow" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Or accept once at the alert and pick "allow always" for the same
session-allowlist effect.

### Mode semantics

- **`standard`** (default): every rule in `permission` is consulted; tools without
  matching rules fall back to `*` (default `allow`).
- **`restrictive`**: like `standard`, but any tool whose rule resolves to `allow`
  via the `*` fallback (no explicit allow rule matched) is converted to `ask`.
  Explicit `allow` rules still allow. Explicit `deny` rules still deny.
- **`accept`** (equivalent to `--accept-all`): auto-allows tools whose targets
  resolve inside the working directory; tools touching paths outside still
  consult `external_directory` rules.
- **`yolo`** (equivalent to `--yolo`): bypasses every check. Use with caution.

CLI precedence (high → low): `--yolo` > `--accept-all` > `--restrictive` >
`default_permission_mode` config > `standard`.

When compiled with MCP support, `mcp_servers` accepts command-based and URL-based
servers:

```json
{
  "mcp_servers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."],
      "env": {}
    },
    "semantic-index": {
      "command": "my-indexer",
      "args": ["--repo", "/work/other-project"],
      "allow_external_paths": true
    },
    "remote-search": {
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "authorization": "Bearer token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If `mcp_servers` is omitted (`null`) and the `mcp` feature is enabled, dirge
adds a default Exa Web Search MCP server at `https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp` with the
`x-api-key` header set to `EXA_API_KEY` when that environment variable is set.
Set `"mcp_servers": {}` to disable all MCP servers.

### Per-server external-path opt-in (`allow_external_paths`)

By default an MCP tool call whose JSON arguments name a path resolving outside
the working directory is refused with a clear error — matching the trust model
of dirge's built-in file tools (`read` / `write` / `edit` anchored to cwd).
The check scans top-level args fields named `path`, `file_path`, `file`,
`directory`, `dir`, `cwd`, and the `paths` array.

Some MCP servers legitimately need broader scope: a semantic indexer pointed
at a sibling repo, a project-wide search tool, a backup utility. Set
`"allow_external_paths": true` on that one server's config (both `Command` and
`Url` variants accept it; default `false`) to skip the cwd guard for tools
from THAT server only.

The flag is path-scoped and narrow:

- It only bypasses the cwd-external-path check.
- It does NOT bypass `mcp_tool` deny rules, prompt `deny_tools` frontmatter,
  doom-loop detection, the sandbox, or `--yolo`/`--restrictive` mode logic —
  every other gate runs unchanged.
- It applies per-server: enabling it on `semantic-index` does not affect
  `filesystem` or any other server in the same config.

Pair it with a tight `mcp_tool` rule for layered control, e.g.:

```json
{
  "mcp_servers": {
    "semantic-index": {
      "command": "indexer",
      "allow_external_paths": true
    }
  },
  "permission": {
    "rules": [
      { "op": "mcp", "match": "mcp_tool:semantic-index:*",          "effect": "allow" },
      { "op": "mcp", "match": "mcp_tool:semantic-index:write_file", "effect": "deny"  }
    ]
  }
}
```

### MCP tools and prompt deny-lists

Per-prompt `deny_tools` frontmatter (see "Prompt restrictions" below) applies
to MCP tools too. The deny gate matches against three names for each MCP tool
call:

- the raw tool name as exported by the MCP server (e.g. `edit`, `write_file`),
- the qualified `mcp_tool:<server>:<name>`,
- the umbrella `mcp_tool` (denies every MCP tool from every server).

So a plan-mode prompt that ships `deny_tools: [edit, write, apply_patch, bash]`
also blocks any MCP server that exports a tool named `edit` / `write` /
`apply_patch` / `bash`. Use `mcp_tool` as a blanket deny when in doubt about
what an MCP server might expose.

## Plugin trust boundary

The Janet plugin system runs INSIDE the trust boundary. Plugin hooks
(`on-tool-start`, `on-tool-end`) can mutate tool inputs, block tool calls,
and replace tool outputs with arbitrary text. They cannot, however, bypass
the permission checker (`check_perm*` runs inside the inner tool, after the
plugin pre-hook). If you load third-party plugins, treat them with the same
care you'd give to executing third-party code in your shell — the plugin's
trust level effectively equals the user's. There is no sandboxing.

### Per-plugin settings (`plugins`)

Plugins are discovered from `~/.config/dirge/plugins/` and
`./.dirge/plugins/` and load automatically. The optional `plugins` object
toggles them by name — the **directory name** (multi-file plugins) or the
**`.janet` file stem** (single-file plugins):

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "backpressured": { "enabled": true, "auto_start": true },
    "nrepl":         { "enabled": false }
  }
}
```

| Field | Default | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Whether to load the plugin. `false` skips it entirely. |
| `auto_start` | `false` | Passed to the plugin via `harness/plugin-config`; a plugin that supports it self-engages at startup (e.g. `backpressured` runs its loop without the keyword). |

A plugin with no entry — or no `plugins` block at all — is **enabled and not
auto-started**, so existing setups load every plugin exactly as before.

Plugin authors: read your own settings in **load-time** code with
`(harness/plugin-config)`, which returns `@{:enabled bool :auto-start bool}`
(or `nil`). The host sets it just before your files load and clears it
after, so capture it at the top level — not from a shared hook, where it
would reflect the last plugin loaded.

## Sandbox configuration

The `sandbox` key accepts three forms:

```jsonc
// 1. boolean — false (off) or true (bubblewrap, Linux)
"sandbox": true

// 2. mode string
"sandbox": "off" | "bwrap" | "microvm"

// 3. object — required for microVM, optional for tuning
"sandbox": {
  "mode": "microvm",        // "off" | "bwrap" | "microvm"
  "image": "alpine:latest", // microVM root image (microvm mode)
  "cpus": 2,                // microVM vCPUs (1–255)
  "memory_mib": 1024        // microVM memory in MiB
}
```

- `bwrap` runs each bash command inside [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) (Linux only; needs the `bwrap` binary). The working directory is bound read-write; the rest of the filesystem is read-only.
- `microvm` runs commands in a full microVM (requires the `sandbox-microvm` build feature). `image`, `cpus`, and `memory_mib` apply only to this mode.
- A legacy nested form `{"mode": "microvm", "microvm": {"image", "cpus", "memory_mib"}}` is still accepted; out-of-range `cpus`/`memory_mib` are now a config error rather than silently wrapping.
- A top-level `microvm_image` key (e.g. `"local://dirge-microvm:alpine"`) is **deprecated** but still honoured as a fallback. Prefer `sandbox.image` above.

## Streaming timeouts

dirge applies a per-chunk read deadline to streaming LLM responses so a
silently-dropped TCP connection (which reqwest can't always detect) doesn't
freeze the agent. The default is 5 minutes (`300s`) — well above any
legitimate reasoning gap from Claude 3.7 extended thinking, GPT-5 thinking,
or large-tool-output processing. Bump it if you see false-positive
`stream chunk timed out` errors in the middle of a turn.

Resolution order (first hit wins):

1. `providers.<name>.stream_chunk_timeout_secs` — per-provider override
2. top-level `stream_chunk_timeout_secs` — applies to every provider
3. `300s` default

Provider name matching is case-insensitive (`anthropic` matches
`--provider Anthropic`).

```json
{
  "stream_chunk_timeout_secs": 300,
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": { "stream_chunk_timeout_secs": 900 },
    "ollama":    { "stream_chunk_timeout_secs": 60 },
    "my-vllm": {
      "provider_type": "openai",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:8000/v1",
      "api_key_env": "VLLM_API_KEY",
      "stream_chunk_timeout_secs": 1200
    }
  }
}
```

## Operation timeouts

Every other per-operation timeout is named in one place — the `timeouts`
block — and installed process-wide at startup. Each field is in seconds;
omitted fields keep their built-in default. (The streaming chunk timeout
above is the one exception with richer per-provider precedence;
`timeouts.stream_chunk_secs` acts as its global fallback.)

| Field | Default | What it bounds |
|---|---|---|
| `stream_chunk_secs` | 300 | Per-chunk read deadline for a streaming LLM response (fallback for the per-provider key above) |
| `request_establish_secs` | 300 | Deadline for establishing a streaming request — the connection/handshake and the wait for the first response event. Distinct from `stream_chunk_secs`, which only guards gaps *between* chunks once the stream is live; a connection that stalls during the handshake never produces a first chunk. A timeout here is retried automatically. Generous by default so it only fires on a genuine stall; lower it for faster failure or raise it if a provider legitimately delays the first response. |
| `tool_call_gap_secs` | 60 | Stall window while a tool call is mid-assembly in the stream. A timeout here is retried automatically when no response text has been emitted yet (the partial tool call is discarded and the request restarted); if text was already shown, the partial is kept to avoid a duplicated response. Raise it only if your provider legitimately pauses longer than 60s between tool-call deltas. |
| `mcp_call_secs` | 120 | Total budget for one MCP tool call, including reconnect + retry |
| `mcp_init_secs` | 10 | MCP server `initialize` handshake |
| `lsp_request_secs` | 30 | Any non-`initialize` LSP request |
| `lsp_initialize_secs` | 45 | LSP `initialize` handshake |
| `bash_secs` | 120 | Default `bash` tool timeout when the call omits one. A DEFAULT, not a bound — the model may pass its own `timeout` and that wins, up to `bash_max_secs` |
| `bash_max_secs` | 3600 | Ceiling on a foreground `bash` timeout, including one the model asked for. Kept separate from `bash_secs` because raising the timeout for a genuinely long command (a full test suite) is correct and clamping every request to the default would break it; this only has to sit above anything real. Lower it to hold commands shorter. Foreground only — a backgrounded shell with no timeout still runs until it exits or is killed |

```json
{
  "timeouts": {
    "mcp_call_secs": 60,
    "lsp_initialize_secs": 90,
    "bash_secs": 300
  }
}
```

## Key bindings

VSCode-style overrides. `keybindings` is an array of
`{ "key": "<chord>", "command": "<command>" }`; each entry layers over the
built-in defaults, so you only list what you want to change. One array
covers BOTH the global "command" keys (scroll, chat nav, …) and the
input-editor keys (cursor motion, kill-ring, history, …) — each entry
routes to the right one by its command name.

```json
{
  "keybindings": [
    { "key": "ctrl-t",        "command": "toggle_reasoning" },
    { "key": "ctrl-shift-k",  "command": "kill_subagent" },
    { "key": "ctrl-r",        "command": "none" },
    { "key": "alt-a",         "command": "cursor_line_start" },
    { "key": "ctrl-x ctrl-s", "command": "scroll_to_top" }
  ]
}
```

- **`key`** — a chord, or a whitespace-separated *sequence* of chords for
  an emacs-style binding (e.g. `ctrl-x ctrl-s`). A chord is
  case-insensitive, `-` or `+` separated, modifiers before the key.
  Modifiers: `ctrl`, `alt` (a.k.a. `meta`/`option`), `shift`. Keys: a
  single character, `f1`–`f12`, or a named key (`enter`, `esc`, `tab`,
  `backspace`, `delete`, `insert`, `space`, `up`/`down`/`left`/`right`,
  `home`, `end`, `pageup`/`pgup`, `pagedown`/`pgdn`). Examples: `ctrl-t`,
  `pageup`, `ctrl-shift-x`, `f5`, `ctrl-x ctrl-s`.
- **`command`** — one of the global or input commands below, or **`none`**
  (also `unbind`) to disable the default binding on that chord (clears it
  from both contexts).
- Binding a command to a new chord **adds** it (the default chord still
  works unless you separately unbind it). Binding a chord that already
  has a default **replaces** it.

### Global commands

| Command | Default | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `toggle_reasoning` | `ctrl-r` | Show/hide reasoning tokens |
| `expand` | `ctrl-o` | Expand buffered thinking / reprint last collapsed tool result |
| `scroll_page_up` | `pageup` | Scroll chat up one page |
| `scroll_page_down` | `pagedown` | Scroll chat down one page |
| `scroll_to_top` | `ctrl-home` | Jump to top of chat |
| `scroll_to_bottom` | `ctrl-end` | Jump to bottom of chat |
| `next_chat` | `ctrl-n` | Next subagent chat window |
| `prev_chat` | `ctrl-p` | Previous subagent chat window |
| `close_chat` | `ctrl-x` | Close the active chat window |
| `kill_subagent` | `ctrl-k` | Kill the focused subagent |
| `drop_queue` | `alt-x` | Drop queued interjections (without cancelling the run) |
| `cycle_prompt` | `shift-tab` | Cycle the active prompt layer to the next available prompt |

### Input-editor commands

| Command | Default | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `cursor_line_start` | `ctrl-a`, `home` | Cursor to start of line |
| `cursor_line_end` | `ctrl-e`, `end` | Cursor to end of line |
| `cursor_left` | `ctrl-b`, `left` | Cursor one character left |
| `cursor_right` | `right` | Cursor one character right |
| `word_left` | `alt-b`, `alt-left` | Cursor one word left |
| `word_right` | `alt-f`, `alt-right` | Cursor one word right |
| `delete_char_back` | `ctrl-h` | Delete character before cursor |
| `delete_char_forward` | `ctrl-d` | Delete character at cursor (forward) |
| `kill_to_line_end` | `ctrl-k` | Kill to end of line |
| `kill_to_line_start` | `ctrl-u` | Kill to start of line |
| `kill_word_back` | `ctrl-w` | Kill word before cursor |
| `delete_word_back` | `alt-backspace` | Delete word before cursor |
| `delete_word_forward` | `alt-d` | Delete word after cursor |
| `yank` | `ctrl-y` | Paste from the kill-ring |
| `yank_pop` | `alt-y` | Cycle the kill-ring at the last yank |
| `history_prev` | `ctrl-p` | Previous history entry |
| `history_next` | `ctrl-n` | Next history entry |
| `reverse_search` | `ctrl-f` | Reverse-i-search over history |
| `line_up` | `up` | Up one line (then history) |
| `line_down` | `down` | Down one line (then history) |
| `undo` | `ctrl-z` | Undo the last edit |
| `external_editor` | `ctrl-g` | Open the current buffer in `$EDITOR` |
| `insert_newline` | `shift-enter`, `alt-enter`, `ctrl-j` | Add a line instead of submitting |

`insert_newline` is how you write a multi-line prompt. `shift-enter` only
reaches dirge on terminals that report it distinctly (see the
`keyboard_enhancement` option above), while `alt-enter` and `ctrl-j` work
everywhere. Plain `enter` always submits and is not rebindable.

Some chords serve both contexts (e.g. `ctrl-k` is `kill_subagent` *and*
`kill_to_line_end`, `ctrl-n` is `next_chat` *and* `history_next`). The
global command only fires in its situation — `kill_subagent` only when the
input box is empty, chat nav only with more than one chat window — so the
editor handler gets the key the rest of the time.

### Chord sequences (emacs-style)

A `key` may be a sequence like `ctrl-x ctrl-s`. After the first chord the
footer shows the pending prefix (`ctrl-x-`) and waits; the next chord
completes (or aborts) the sequence. **Esc** or **Ctrl+G** cancels a
pending prefix. By default a pending prefix waits indefinitely (emacs
style); set `"chord_timeout_ms": <n>` at the top level of the config to
auto-cancel it after `n` milliseconds of inactivity. Sequences fire for
**global commands only**; a sequence bound to an input command is rejected
with a startup warning. Binding a sequence whose first chord is also a
single-key command disables that single-key binding (the sequence wins) —
you'll see a warning.

Notes:
- **Always fixed** (never rebindable): the cancel/interrupt gesture
  **Ctrl+C / Esc** (the panic button) and intrinsic editing —
  typing a character, **Backspace**, **Delete**, **Enter** to submit,
  **Ctrl+J** (insert newline), and **Tab** completion. Binding a global
  command to one of these chords shadows the intrinsic behavior while
  active.
- Plugins can also add and override bindings; user config always wins over
  a plugin. See [plugins.md](plugins.md#keyboard-shortcuts).
- Unrecognized chords or unknown commands are skipped with a warning on
  startup; the rest of the config still loads.

## Command history (cross-session recall)

Pressing **Up** in the input box recalls previous prompts, and **Ctrl+F**
opens a reverse-i-search over them. By default the recall pool is the
*current* session's prompts. Set top-level `max_sessions` to an integer
`N` (default `3`) to additionally mine the `N` most-recent *prior*
sessions in the same project (matching `working_dir`) for their user
prompts. Those older prompts are seeded ahead of the current session's
own, so Up starts from your newest command and walks back through earlier
conversations in the project.

The scan is scoped to the same project and excludes the current
conversation's own compaction-fold rotations, so a fold doesn't double its
prompts into history. Set `"max_sessions": 0` to keep recall limited to
the current session. Synthetic turns (system-reminder wrappers, mid-turn
steering, auto-continue markers) never enter history.

## Slash-command aliases

Rename a built-in slash command, or give it a short alias, with the
top-level `slash_aliases` map. The key is what you type (with or without a
leading `/`); the value is the built-in command it runs (again with or
without a leading `/`). Arguments you type after the alias are passed
through to the target.

```json
{
  "slash_aliases": {
    "exit": "quit",
    "q": "/quit",
    "cls": "/clear"
  }
}
```

With the above, `/exit`, `/q`, and `/cls` all run `/quit` or `/clear`. The
alias is resolved once before dispatch, so it inherits its target's
behavior (e.g. an alias for `/quit` works while the agent is running).

- Aliases don't replace the built-in — both names work unless they
  collide (an alias key that matches a built-in shadows it).
- A leading `/` on either side is optional and normalized.
- A target that isn't a known built-in produces a startup warning (likely
  a typo) but is still passed through — it may resolve to a plugin
  command. Plugin-command targets can't be validated ahead of time.
- An empty alias key is ignored (with a warning); it would otherwise make
  a bare `/` run the target.
- Configured aliases are listed under `slash aliases` in `/help`.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `EXA_API_KEY` | API key for the built-in `websearch` tool and the default Exa MCP server. Without this the `websearch` tool emits a startup warning and is not registered. |
| `DIRGE_WEBFETCH_ALLOW_PRIVATE` | Set to `1` (or any non-empty value) to allow `webfetch` to call private / loopback IPs. By default `webfetch` enforces SSRF protection — it refuses `localhost`, `127.x`, `10.x`, `172.16-31.x`, `192.168.x`, and link-local addresses. Override only in trusted local-dev contexts; never set this in production environments that touch attacker-influenced URLs. |
| `WEBSEARCH_ENABLED` / `WEBFETCH_ENABLED` | Force-enable the corresponding tool when not enabled via `tools.*` config. Useful in container builds where you set the toggle once via env rather than per-config-file. |
| `DIRGE_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL` | `5m` or `1h`, overriding `[prompt_cache] ttl`. See [Prompt caching](#prompt-caching) for the cost tradeoff. |

## LSP configuration

When compiled with the `lsp` feature (default-on), dirge spawns language
servers on demand to surface compile errors in tool output. The `lsp` config
key accepts three forms:

```json
// Default-on, built-in commands for rust/typescript/pyright/clojure-lsp.
{ "lsp": true }

// Off entirely. Same as the --no-lsp CLI flag.
{ "lsp": false }

// Default-on with per-server overrides.
{
  "lsp": {
    "rust": {
      "command": ["rust-analyzer"],
      "env": { "RA_LOG": "rust_analyzer=debug" },
      "initialization": { "cargo": { "buildScripts": { "enable": true } } }
    },
    "typescript": { "disabled": true }
  }
}
```

Per-server fields (all optional):

| Field            | Type             | Description |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| `command`           | string[] | argv to launch the server. Replaces the built-in default. |
| `extensions`        | string[] | **Replaces** the server's built-in extension list. |
| `extend_extensions` | string[] | **Appends** to the built-in list (deduped). e.g. route `.janet` to `clojure-lsp` without re-listing clj/cljs/cljc/edn/bb. Accepts `extendExtensions` too. |
| `env`               | object   | extra env vars for the child process. |
| `initialization`    | object   | sent as `initializationOptions` in the LSP `initialize` request. |
| `disabled`          | boolean  | `true` removes the server entirely. |

Example — make `clojure-lsp` also handle Janet files (keeps the built-in Clojure extensions):

```json
{ "lsp": { "clojure-lsp": { "extend_extensions": ["janet"] } } }
```

CLI flag: `--no-lsp` (overrides the config; same effect as `lsp: false`).

### Built-in server commands

| Server id            | Default command                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `rust`               | `rust-analyzer`                              |
| `typescript`         | `typescript-language-server --stdio`         |
| `pyright`            | `pyright-langserver --stdio`                 |
| `clojure-lsp`        | `clojure-lsp`                                |
| `gopls`              | `gopls`                                      |
| `jdtls`              | `jdtls`                                      |
| `clangd`             | `clangd`                                     |
| `ruby-lsp`           | `ruby-lsp`                                   |
| `bash-language-server` | `bash-language-server start`               |
| `dafny`              | `dafny server --verify-on change`            |
| `swift`              | `sourcekit-lsp`                              |
| `cmake`              | `cmake-language-server`                      |
| `mojo`               | `mojo-lsp-server`                            |

Servers are spawned lazily on first file touch and cached per `(workspace_root, server_id)` pair. Concurrent agent tool calls for the same file deduplicate so dirge never races two `rust-analyzer` processes against one workspace.

### Known limitations

- The `extensions` override is currently ignored. The claimed-extensions list lives in the static `builtin_servers()` registry at `src/lsp/server.rs`. Adding new extensions today requires editing that file. Follow-up.

## ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) configuration

When compiled with the `acp` feature, dirge can act as an ACP agent server.
The following config keys are available:

| Key           | Type    | Description                                            |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `acp_servers` | object  | Named ACP server configurations (see below)            |

dirge's ACP runs over stdio only; the `acp_host` / `acp_port`
keys that earlier docs mentioned have been removed from the CLI
and config in favor of editors driving the agent via stdio.

ACP server configs (in `acp_servers`) support two transport types:

```json
{
  "acp_servers": {
    "tcp-server": {
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 7243,
      "api_key": "optional-key"
    }
  }
}
```

When `--acp` is passed without `--acp-host`, dirge runs in stdio mode
(the editor spawns it as a subprocess). With `--acp-host`, it listens on TCP.
