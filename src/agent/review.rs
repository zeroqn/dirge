//! Background review at session end.
//!
//! Port of Hermes's `agent/background_review.py`. After every session,
//! a forked agent with limited tools (memory + skill only) reviews the
//! transcript and writes project learnings to MEMORY.md, PITFALLS.md,
//! and skills.
//!
//! The review runs as a fire-and-forget tokio task — it never blocks
//! the main session. If it fails, the error is logged and the session
//! continues unaffected.
//!
//! Key design decisions from Hermes preserved:
//! - Fork, don't inline (separate agent instance, no prompt-cache pollution)
//! - Tool whitelist (only memory + skill tools)
//! - Same credentials as parent session
//! - Frozen conversation snapshot
//! - Fire-and-forget (daemon thread pattern)

const COMBINED_REVIEW_PROMPT: &str = r#"Review the conversation above and update what we know about this project and how to work on it.

**CRITICAL: You have ONLY the `memory` and `skill` tools available.** Do not attempt to use read, write, edit, bash, or any other tools — they are not loaded.

**1. Update MEMORY (project facts, conventions, pitfalls):**
- What build/test commands were discovered or confirmed?
- What naming conventions, file layout patterns, or import styles were used?
- What architecture patterns emerged (how modules relate, error handling style)?
- What library quirks or tool behaviors were discovered?
- Were there any user corrections about how things should be done?
- Was something tried and failed? Capture what was attempted and WHY it failed.

Classify every entry you save with the `kind` parameter — it drives how memory ranks and what gets evicted first when the budget is full:
  • `semantic` — a durable fact or preference ("this project pins the MSRV in rust-toolchain.toml").
  • `procedural` — a how-to rule or convention ("run `cargo fmt --all` before committing"). Default for AGENTS.md-style guidance.
  • `episodic` — a specific past event worth recalling ("the 0.3 cut broke because the lockfile wasn't regenerated").
  • `identity` — who the user/agent is ("operator prefers terse, no-preamble handoffs").
  • `working` — short-lived task context. Rarely worth saving and the FIRST to be evicted under budget pressure — prefer not to persist it, EXCEPT for open-thread carry-over (see 1d).
When unsure, use `semantic` for facts and `procedural` for rules.

**1a. Keep the PROJECT OVERVIEW current.** Maintain exactly ONE `overview`-kind entry: a minimal (≤5 lines) high-level orientation of the project — what it is, its language/stack, the rough source layout, and how to build/test/run it. This is the gestalt a future session should read first. If no overview exists yet, create it with `memory(action='add', kind='overview', content='...')`; the deterministic session ground-truth above is a good starting point. If one exists and the big picture has changed (or it is missing something foundational), REPLACE it — adding an `overview` overwrites the existing one in place, so just `add` the refreshed version. Keep it stable and short: it is orientation, not a changelog. Do nothing here if the current overview is still accurate.

**1b. Record procedural OUTCOMES.** A `procedural` memory is a playbook, and its value is whether it actually works. If the conversation shows an existing procedural entry being applied and the result is clear, record it with `memory(action='mark', old_text='<id-or-substring>', outcome='success'|'failure')`:
  • `success` — the rule was followed and the thing worked, or the user confirmed it ("thanks, that worked").
  • `failure` — following the rule led to a broken or rejected result ("that didn't help", the step had to be undone).
This ranks proven playbooks above ones that fail in practice and keeps effective rules from decaying. Only mark when the transcript makes the outcome unambiguous; skip it otherwise. Marking applies to `procedural` entries only.

**1c. Supersede CONTRADICTED facts.** When the conversation shows an existing memory entry is now WRONG or outdated — the user changed a preference, a fact was corrected, an approach was abandoned — do NOT silently `replace` it (that erases the old fact). Use `memory(action='supersede', old_text='<id-or-substring>', content='<corrected fact>', harsh=<bool>)`:
  • `harsh=false` (default) — a natural update: the user changed their mind or a fact simply changed. The new fact is written at normal confidence.
  • `harsh=true` — the user flatly DENIED the old fact ("no, that's wrong", "we never did that"). The new fact is held at reduced confidence because the area is contested.
Supersession keeps the old entry as an audit record and removes it from active memory. Use `replace` only for rewording the SAME fact; use `supersede` when the fact itself changed.

**1d. Carry over OPEN THREADS for the next session.** If the session ended with work genuinely unfinished — an in-progress todo, a half-applied change, an explicit "next I'll…", a known-but-unfixed issue — record each as a SHORT `working`-kind entry so the next session can resume where this one stopped. The deterministic session ground-truth above (open todos, uncommitted files, where we stopped) is your source; only carry threads that are actually still open. Conversely, when a prior session's `working` carry-over is now DONE (the todo completed, the change landed), `remove` it so stale resume notes don't accumulate. This is the one case where persisting `working` memory is wanted; everything else about `working` (transient, first-evicted) still holds — keep these few and specific, not a narrative of the session.

**2. Update SKILLS (procedural improvements):**
Be ACTIVE — most sessions produce at least one skill update. A pass that does nothing is a missed learning opportunity.

Preference order — prefer the earliest that fits:
  1. UPDATE A CURRENTLY-LOADED SKILL. If the conversation involved a skill that is already in the library, extend or correct it first.
  2. UPDATE AN EXISTING UMBRELLA. If the new knowledge belongs under a broader topic that already has a skill, patch it.
  3. ADD A SUPPORT FILE under an existing umbrella via the skill tool (references/, templates/, or scripts/).
  4. CREATE A NEW CLASS-LEVEL UMBRELLA SKILL only when no existing skill covers the class.

Signals that warrant action:
  • User corrected your style, approach, or workflow. Frustration signals like "stop doing X", "this is too verbose", "don't format like this", or an explicit "remember this" are FIRST-CLASS skill signals.
  • Non-trivial technique, fix, workaround, or debugging pattern emerged.
  • A skill that was loaded or consulted turned out wrong or outdated — PATCH IT NOW.
  • A pattern repeated across the session that future sessions would benefit from.

Do NOT capture:
  • Environment-dependent failures: missing binaries, "command not found", unconfigured credentials. The user can fix these — they are not durable rules.
  • Negative claims about tools ("read tool is broken", "cannot use X"). These harden into refusals long after the actual problem was fixed.
  • Session-specific transient errors that resolved before the conversation ended.
  • One-off task narratives. "Analyze this PR" is not a class of work that warrants a skill.

Target shape of the library: CLASS-LEVEL skills with a rich SKILL.md. Not a long flat list of narrow one-session-one-skill entries.

"Nothing to save." is valid but should NOT be the default. Most coding sessions produce at least one learning."#;
