///
/// The finalization boundary has had this discipline since dirge-vcsn —
/// [`poll_finalization_follow_up`] polls its gates in strict priority and
/// returns the first non-empty source. The mid-turn boundary never got it:
/// track-work, fast-verify, the progress signal, the file-touch reminder and
/// the safe-state/reflection rungs each pushed independently, so up to five
/// harness messages could land before one assistant turn. The only mutual
/// exclusions were two hand-written special cases, and the priority reasoning
/// was written in a comment ("runs LAST ... shouldn't pre-empt them") while
/// the code emitted everything anyway.
///
/// Priority runs most-specific first. A safe-state abort supersedes the
/// recovery checkpoint it replaces (telling the model to both retry and abort
/// is contradictory — the exclusion that used to be special-cased is now just
/// ordering). Progress is last because a stall diagnosis is the broadest thing
/// we can say, and saying it over a concrete instruction is noise.
///
/// ONE WART, deliberate. `ProgressTracker::record_turn` both advances the
/// barren-boundary counters AND returns the message, so it must be called on
/// every boundary or the stall and prologue signals freeze — it cannot be
/// short-circuited by a higher-priority winner. When something outranks it,
/// its message is dropped and that nudge's budget is spent on nothing. The
/// cost is bounded (MAX_STALL_NUDGES is 2, MAX_PROLOGUE_NUDGES is 1) and only
/// applies on a boundary where the model already received something more
/// specific. Splitting `record_turn` into advance-then-peek would remove it;
/// that is a change to progress.rs's contract and is left for dirge-5mtx.7,
/// which reworks these budgets anyway.
///
/// `poll_budget` is NOT called when something else wins: it consumes a budget
/// mark, and unlike `record_turn` it has no state to advance, so skipping it
/// preserves the mark for a later boundary.
/// Record one tool result's capability signals on the run tally [dirge-5mtx.7].
///
/// Every call counts toward `tool_calls` (the denominator for every rate) and,
/// when it failed, toward the errored count FOR ITS RECOVERY CLASS
/// (dirge-s9ry). A failed call whose name is in no tool the run was given is
/// ALSO recorded as a hallucinated name — the model invented the name rather
/// than misusing a real tool, which is a materially different capability
/// signal.
///
/// The class comes from the same `tool_error_class::classify` the failure
/// tracker uses on the same excerpt, so the checkpoint's account of a streak
/// and the estimator's account of the run cannot disagree about what a failure
/// was.
///
/// `prepare_tool_call` (tools.rs) is where the miss is actually detected: it
/// short-circuits with "Tool X not found" plus a nearest-name suggestion. But
/// it runs inside `execute_tool_calls_{sequential,parallel}`, neither of which
/// has the tally, and the parallel path shares its preflight across futures.
/// Re-deriving the classification here from the same tool list keeps the
/// counter next to every other one rather than threading `&mut GateTally`
/// through two batch executors.
///
/// The two counts STACK deliberately: a hallucinated call is both errored and
/// hallucinated, exactly as `repair_invalid` already stacks with errored. With
/// the current weights that orders the failure kinds — a plain error is 1, an
/// invented tool name 3, arguments too malformed to repair 5 — which is the
/// intended ranking.
///
/// KEEPING that ranking is why an invented name is classed [`ErrorClass::Misuse`]
/// rather than run through the classifier (dirge-s9ry). `prepare_tool_call`
/// phrases the miss as "Tool X not found", which the classifier reads — quite
/// reasonably — as [`ErrorClass::MissingInfo`], the one class that scores
/// double. That would have made an invented name 2 + 2 = 4, silently
/// re-ranking it against `repair_invalid` and counting ONE failure twice on
/// the same axis: `hallucinated_tool_names` already exists to say precisely
/// this. `Misuse` is also the honest label — an unknown tool name is the call
/// shape being wrong, not the tree being shaped differently than the model
/// thought.
///
/// Adding this signal can only ever move a run DOWN a tier, never up, so the
/// worst case is a run that read `Strong` reading `Nominal`, which is today's
/// default behaviour. That is why restoring it is safe despite its effect on
/// tiering being unmeasured: the counter was always zero, so nobody has data
